  - Auto-hide functionality
  - Different error types (network, upload, correction, etc.)
  - Custom hook for error state management

### 8. Updated Timeline Integration
- **File**: `src/pages/Timeline.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced upload modal with better placeholder text
  - Integrated enhanced meal display in detail modal
  - Comprehensive error handling throughout
  - Updated meal state management

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Upload Flow Testing
1. **Open the app** and navigate to Timeline
2. **Click the camera button** to open upload modal
3. **Select meal images** and add a description like "Chicken curry for lunch"
4. **Upload the meal** and verify the enhanced response includes:
   - Confidence score
   - User description with relevance scoring
   - Alternatives (if confidence < 70%)
   - Correction options

### 2. Alternatives Testing
1. **Upload a meal** with low confidence or unclear image
2. **Verify alternatives appear** in the meal detail modal
3. **Click on an alternative** to select it
4. **Verify the meal updates** with the selected alternative
5. **Check that alternatives hide** after selection

### 3. Quick Edit Testing
1. **Open a meal** in the detail modal
2. **Use the portion slider** to adjust size
3. **Click calorie adjustment buttons** to modify calories
4. **Verify real-time updates** without page refresh
5. **Check processing indicators** during updates

### 4. Text Correction Testing
1. **Click "Needs Correction"** on a low-confidence meal
2. **Select correction type** (wrong identification/different food)
3. **Add detailed feedback** like "This is actually biryani, not curry"
4. **Submit the correction** and verify success
5. **Check that correction modal closes** and meal updates

### 5. Accuracy Feedback Testing
1. **Click "Accurate" button** on a meal
2. **Verify correction options hide** after marking as accurate
3. **Check that confidence indicators** update appropriately

### 6. Error Handling Testing
1. **Test with poor network connection** to see network errors
2. **Try uploading invalid files** to see upload errors
3. **Test correction submissions** with network issues
4. **Verify error messages auto-hide** after 5 seconds

## UI/UX Guidelines Implemented

### Confidence Indicators
- **High (≥70%)**: Green badge, minimal correction options
- **Medium (40-69%)**: Yellow badge, show alternatives
- **Low (<40%)**: Red badge, show all correction options

### Alternative Display
- Shows up to 3 alternatives
- Includes confidence percentage and reasoning
- Easy selection with visual feedback
- Hides after selection

### Quick Edit Controls
- Portion slider: 0.5x to 3.0x range
- Calorie adjustment: ±20% buttons
- Real-time updates without full re-analysis

### Correction Flow
- Thumbs up: Mark as accurate, hide correction options
- Thumbs down: Open text correction modal
- Alternative selection: Update meal immediately

## Backend Integration Notes

The frontend is ready for the new backend endpoints:
- `POST /meals/upload` - Enhanced response format
- `POST /meals/{meal_id}/correction` - Submit corrections
- `POST /meals/{meal_id}/select-alternative` - Select alternatives
- `POST /meals/{meal_id}/accurate` - Mark as accurate

## Migration Strategy

1. **Backend changes deployed** ✅ (Ready for new endpoints)
2. **Frontend updated** ✅ (Handles new fields gracefully)
3. **Enhanced features enabled** ✅ (For beta users)
4. **Full rollout** (After testing)

## Performance Considerations

- Alternatives only shown when needed (confidence < 0.7)
- Quick edits use deterministic calculations (no LLM calls)
- Text corrections trigger re-analysis only when necessary
- Error handling prevents duplicate API calls
- Loading states provide clear user feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real backend** when endpoints are available
2. **Gather user feedback** on new correction features
3. **Monitor performance** of enhanced analysis
4. **Iterate on UI/UX** based on user behavior
5. **Expand to other pages** (ShareMeal, etc.) if successful
